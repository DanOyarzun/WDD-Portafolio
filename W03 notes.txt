This week lesson that I learned about was about Objects, the Document Object Model (DOM) and Events.

I learned to create objects literals wich are an object in JavaScript is a self-contained set of related values and functions and accesing to their properties
by using the dot notation. An example of this is create any object by wrapping all its properties and methods in curly braces.

The DOM is an interface that allows us to use JavaScript to interact with a web page. This is incredible useful because we can use any JS script or funtion that we want
to interact with the website and the user. The limit is the imagination.

DOM is a poweful tool in webdesign to manipulate HTML tags and all the subelements in it. we can adding and removing elements, changing the order,
content and attributes of elements, and even altering how they are styled (CSS).

Events are another part of the DOM and they are what provides the link between the web page and user interactions. 
Every time a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking on a link, pressing a key, or moving a mouse, 
an event occurs that our program can detect and then respond to. We use Event listeners to call functions that do something when these events happens.
One example could be a Click function, that is programmed to do some action when a click is registered, and is called by an event listener.
