The Lesson from this week was about HTML forms. Form is the most common way to interact with

A web page.  The HTML form element ( <form>)on a web page allows a user to enter data, most of

the time personal data like, name, password, contact,etc. This data is sent to a server for processing.

Forms most times can resemble paper or database forms because the user fills the form using text fields, radio buttons or check boxes.

The HTML form element can contain any of the the following form elements: input, label, select,

textarea, button, fieldset, legend, datalist, output, etc.

Form data can be retrieved later from the server to any use.

I laso learned about Object-oriented programming. OOP is a style of programming that involves

separating the code into objects that have properties and methods. This approach has the benefit

of keeping related pieces of code encapsulated in objects that maintain state throughout the life

of the program, so code can be reused.  I also learned about Encapsultaion, polymorphism, inheritance, classes. 

Then we use the object properties to create method that can be used in any “parent “ property as classes are, 

and then by using constructor functions instances of the objects

Can be created. Class keyword is used in JS, also in other lenguages.
